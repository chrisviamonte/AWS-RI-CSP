AWS RI &amp; Cost Savings Plans Data Analysis

Welcome to the development of AWS RI and Cost Savings Data Analysis Tool.

After four years of RI Management for a large $50M+ deployment across multiple master payers, I wrote applications to automating 
expert knowledge for managing AWS Cost Optimization and Savings.

As part of a lifelong learning journey, I wish to give back to the community for what it has given so kindly to me thru shared knowledge and toolsets.

This site be contributing self-developed tools in a disciplined framework.

The first project is based upon screen scraping AWS RI and CSP Costing Data and creating a dataset.
